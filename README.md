# peg-solitaire-backtracking
I went for a coffee to [Cult Espresso](http://www.cult-espresso.com/) cafe in Edinburgh with a bunch of friends and we started playing [Cracker Barrel peg solitaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILKXEnX_YGM). After couple of attempts I made a backtracking search to solve the game instead.
